## This program removes barcode sequences from fastq reads and places them
## in the name. This program also removes adpater sequences from the 3' end.
## Qual scores corresponding to the removed barcode and adapter are removed 
## as well. The reads are separted into separate files based on species and
## enzymes (for the pines). This part of the code will not be necessary in 
## most cases where each lane contains a single experiment. Sequences not
## matching any barcodes are written to a separate file (miderrors.txt).

## This now includes a function for correcting barcodes that are off by 1.

## Version 1.0, 11ii13, includes consisten dash format and always grabs four rows of sequences
